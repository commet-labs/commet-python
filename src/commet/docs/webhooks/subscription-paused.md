All webhook payloads follow a consistent top-level structure with event-specific data nested within the `data` object.

- `subscriptionId` (string) — The paused subscription ID.
- `customerId` (string) — The customer ID for the paused subscription.
- `status` ("paused") — The subscription status after pausing.
- `mode` ("immediate" | "period\_end") — How the pause became effective.
- `effectiveAt` (string) — When the pause becomes or became effective.
- `resumeAt` (string | null) — When automatic resume is scheduled, or null when indefinite.
